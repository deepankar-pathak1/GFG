You can only use the formula for area and circumference of a circle in terms of PI.


Use concept of montey Carlo

for triangle 

ratio(1/2) = Number of points in triangle/Number of points in box







# Area of square = 1
# Area of circle = PI * 0.5^2 = PI/4

# Refernce: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximations_of_%CF%80 [Many many algorithms]

# Lets now use randomization  [a.k.a Monte carlo simualtion]
# Permutation-tets in HYpothesis tetsing in our AI Course is another example of Monte-Carlo simualtions

import random
import math

def inCircle(x , y):
    if  math.sqrt((x-0.5)**2 + (y-0.5)**2) <= 0.5:
        return True;
    else:
        return False;


cntInCircle = 0;
n = 10000000;

for i in range(n):
    x = random.random();
    y = random.random();
    
    if inCircle(x,y):
        cntInCircle += 1;
        
print (cntInCircle/n * 4);
